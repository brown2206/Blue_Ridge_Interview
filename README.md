# Blue_Ridge_Interview

## Programming Interview Project 1

At Blue Ridge Dynamics, Inc. we aim to have a detailed interview process that ensures both the
candidate and BRD work well together. Part of the process includes a standard interview
session with team members. In addition, we like to assess your ability to work independently on
projects. One way to evaluate this is to allow you to work on a small project before coming into
the interview. This allows you to demonstrate your abilities and facilitates discussion points
during the interview. During the interview session, you will be expected to discuss your project
with other team members.

Description

Implement a multi-user web based application using HTML5, Reactjs and a Python based Flask
backend rest service to view and analyze personal demographic data provided in the
interview_sample_data_01.csv. This web application should contain the following pages:

1. A Login page that authenticates the user via the rest service.
2. Allow two users access to the application with usernames tom and harry, both using the
password “password”.
3. A data centric view to display the provided data set using a Table that is provided via the
rest service.

Feel free to use another technology stack if it makes sense, and provide a short justification on
your decision.

Please submit your project by creating a github project and sharing the repo via email.
Please include instructions on how to run your application in a readme.md file.
